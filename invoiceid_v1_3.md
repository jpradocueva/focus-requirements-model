# Invoice ID

An Invoice ID is a invoice-issuer-assigned identifier for an invoice encapsulating [*charges*](#glossary:charge) in the corresponding [*billing period*](#glossary:billing-period) for a given [*billing account*](#glossary:billing-account). Invoices are commonly used for scenarios like tracking billing transactions, facilitating payment processes and for performing invoice reconciliation between *charges* and billing periods.

## Requirements

InvoiceId adheres to the following requirements:

* InvoiceId is RECOMMENDED to be present in a Cost and Usage [*FOCUS dataset*](#glossary:FOCUS-dataset).
* InvoiceId MUST be of type String.
* InvoiceId MUST conform to [StringHandling](#stringhandling) requirements.
* The sum of BilledCost for a given [InvoiceId](#invoiceid) MUST match the sum of the payable amount provided in the corresponding invoice with the same id generated by the [InvoiceIssuerName](#InvoiceIssuerName).
* InvoiceId nullability is defined as follows:
  * InvoiceId MUST be null when the *charge* is not associated either with an invoice or with a pre-generated provisional invoice.
  * InvoiceId MUST NOT be null when the *charge* is associated with either an issued invoice or a pre-generated provisional invoice.
* InvoiceId MAY be generated prior to an invoice being issued.
* InvoiceId MUST be associated with the related *charge* and BillingAccountId when a pre-generated invoice or provisional invoice exists.
